# Test_automation_basic
this is avery basic test automation i have done for my QA associate interview at Virtusa.
if you are also facing such an interview I recomment you to study this since it is a very basic one , rather than studing huge projects
this project is developed with Eclipse IDE , Selenium Web Driver and TestNG plugin
this project only works with Firefox browser (Gecko driver is included)
if you want to use another browser, download the driver and edit the driver in System.getProperty


Firefox
